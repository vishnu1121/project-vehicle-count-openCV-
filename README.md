The background subtraction module would be responsible for analyzing the extracted frames and identifying the moving objects within them. This is often a crucial step in tasks such as vehicle detection and counting, as it allows the system to focus on the objects that are of interest, and ignore the static background elements. To perform this task, the module would use algorithms such as backgroundSubtractorMOG2, which is specifically designed for identifying moving objects in video streams. The backgroundSubtractorMOG2 algorithm works by comparing the current frame to a reference background frame, and identifying the pixels that have changed between the two frames. These pixels correspond to the moving objects in the frame, and they are isolated as the "foreground" elements. The remainder of the image, consisting of pixels that have not changed between the two frames, is considered the "background" and is subtracted from the image. By using this or similar algorithms, the background subtraction module can effectively identify and track the moving objects in the video stream, and provide this information to other parts of the system for further processing
